## Overview
In this project, we are introducing how to setup and use Github, Github Desktop, and WebStorm. 

## What the project does
In this repository, I created two folders name Source (contains 1 HTML file) and Documentation (contains files such as screenshots)

* In this ICP, we installed 
    * Github Desktop https://github.com/
    * Webstorm IDE https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/

* Created repositories remotely and cloned to local machine
* Created folders on local Github
* Create, fork, pull, and sync to remote repository

## Why is this useful?
* Github is a useful open-source platform
  * It can be used for version control
  * Great for students to use for group project
  * Team members can work on the same project and make changes to project
* Github Desktop makes it easier to use version control
* Alternative solution to Git (Easier for beginner to understand GUI)
* Webstorm is useful for modern JavaScript development
  * Provides support for JS, TS, HTML, CSS, and etc.
  * Easier to use and run solution (Previous experience using Visual Studio with ASP.NET with C# for web design)
  * Free for student use
  
  * Useful for mock up website
